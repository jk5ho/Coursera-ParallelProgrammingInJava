# Parallel Programming in Java

[Parallel Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java)


This course teaches learners (industry professionals and students) the fundamental concepts of parallel programming in the context of Java 8. Parallel programming enables developers to use multicore computers to make their applications run faster by using multiple processors at the same time. By the end of this course, you will learn how to use popular parallel Java frameworks (such as ForkJoin, Stream, and Phaser) to write parallel programs for a wide range of multicore platforms including servers, desktops, or mobile devices, while also learning about their theoretical foundations including computation graphs, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

-	Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism
-	Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework
-	Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks
-	Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)
-	Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks
